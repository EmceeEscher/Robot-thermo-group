** Attributes:
*** minorModes: array of MinorMode
    Array of minor modes that are compatible with the major mode
*** activeMinorModes: array of bool
    Array or true or false, signifying whether the associated minor mode 
    is active
*** failureModes: array of FailureMode
    Array of failure modes that might be entered from the current major mode
*** activeFailureMode: int
