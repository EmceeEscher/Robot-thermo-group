* Logistics
** TODO Find way to fix CMakeFile.txt so that CLion can properly evaluate files

* Planning
** TODO Determine the structure of the intersection detection
** TODO Find a way to store intersections in a graph?
** TODO Design the specifics of the overall looping structure
** TODO Decide whether the main loop should actually loop or run just once
** TODO Design a State class that holds all of the major and minor modes
** TODO Design a main menu function that allows user to choose functionalities
   + Use knobs to choose items and start button to select, stop button to go back
   + Use knobs to adjust variables
** TODO Design some sort of testing suite that can operate modes individually
   + Allow user to control operation and output so code reuploading is unnecessary

* Implementation
** TODO Implement TapeFollower as a MinorMode
** TODO Write an abstract class FailureMode that is a subtype of MinorMode
