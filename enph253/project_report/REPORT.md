### <a name="about"></a> About the Project
---
	For the final exam of our ENPH 253 class, we had to design and build a completely autonomous robot that would compete in an “Uber-bot” competition against the robots created by our classmates. The premise of the “Uber-bot” competition was to create miniaturized versions of the self-driving cars that are currently under development by companies such as Uber and Google. A miniature city was created, with foam buildings and electrical tape roads, and stuffed animals scattered around the city as passengers. The robot vehicles were required to be completely autonomous; that is, there could be no remote control of the robots by the team members. The robots had to detect both the IR beacons and the tape they were driving on, and all decisions had to be made using nothing more than the robots’ internal software and the data received through its sensors.
	The rules of the competition were fairly simple. Robots had two minutes per heat to drive around the city, identify and pick up passengers, and transport them to a set dropoff location. The passengers were marked by small ground-level IR beacons, emitting at a frequency of 1 KHz. The dropoff zone was marked by a beacon about 10 inches off of the ground, emitting infrared light at a frequency of 10 KHz. Two teams’ robots would be on the competition surface at once, and were required to detect collisions with other robots, and back up and turn around when one happened.

Our [Formal Design Proposal](./Formal\ Design\ Document.pdf) 
describes in detail the design as we originally envisioned it.

The following are highlights of our final design, including its
mechanical, electrical, and software features.

chassis and drive system

* [_**Electrical**_][elec]: Information about the
circuit and sensor design

* [_**Software**_][soft]: Information about the
software system.
